# Hello!

Do you _love_ setting up projects for hours just so you can get to what you
wanted to try?  Me neither!  Use this as a starting point.

## Get Started

```sh
git clone git@github.com:reergymerej/react-springboard.git your-cool-app
cd your-cool-app
```

### Install

```sh
yarn
```

### Run

```sh
yarn start
```


## Change Repo

After you've made it your own, you can change the repo.

```sh
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:yourname/your-cool-app.git
git push -u origin master
```
